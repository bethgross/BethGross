## Hello, I'm Beth

Complicated problems are my favorite kind. I like breaking them down, untangling messy data, and turning it into clear stories that spark action. Iâ€™ve built analytics foundations end-to-end â€” pipelines, models, experiments, dashboards. My sweet spot is digital product and growth analytics, where I get to connect numbers with business outcomes (and have some fun in the process).

Me, in a nutshell:

## Portfolio

Iâ€™m in the process of adding more public projects here. For now, a few highlights:

### Developing Intuition
I like to dig into the nuts and bolts of processes, algorithms, and problems with the goal of making them intuitive and clear.  

#### Examples
* [Fitting Linear Regressions](https://github.com/bethgross/developing-intuition/blob/a3547bd2b87d227418e788c42805d22cd605ef81/linear_regression.ipynb)
* [Building a website using Hugo (without a theme)](https://github.com/bethgross/my-hugo-site)


## Beyond Data

Outside of analytics, I:  
- Freedive, swim, and paddleboard  
- Carve wooden spoons and love to cook  
- Hike and explore new places  
- Tinker and learn new things (currently: acoustic guitar)  
- Read, recharge, and watch SailGP and tennis
