## Hello, I'm Beth

Complicated problems are my favorite kind. I like breaking them down, untangling messy data, and turning it into clear stories that spark action. Iâ€™ve built analytics foundations end-to-end â€” pipelines, models, experiments, dashboards. My sweet spot is digital product and growth analytics, where I get to connect numbers with business outcomes (and have some fun in the process).

## Portfolio

Iâ€™m in the process of adding more public projects here. For now, a few highlights:

* [Fitting Linear Regressions](https://github.com/bethgross/developing-intuition/blob/a3547bd2b87d227418e788c42805d22cd605ef81/linear_regression.ipynb)
* [Code Drills and Skills - Basic to Advanced](https://github.com/bethgross/skills-drills.git)

## Currently working on

* Studing and practicing methods to evaluate the performance and impact of AI models
* Thinking about empirical analysis as applied to AI:
  * What measurement methods exist in other industries that could be applied here? For example, could certain principles of psychometrics be applied to an LLM?
  * How can we overcome the fundamental challenge of reproducibility with AI models?
  * How much randomness is there in a model? Does it apply to all elements (words, numbers), and does it change over time? 

## Beyond Data

Outside of analytics, I:  
- Freedive, swim, and stand-up paddleboard  
- Carve wooden spoons and love to cook  
- Tinker and learn new things (currently: AI tools and acoustic guitar)
